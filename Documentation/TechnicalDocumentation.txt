This will open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013

The current database, Database1, is within the project.
To put another database in it must be put in the SheaMeyers_AssesmentProject
folder and must be a type .mdf to work.
The database needs to contain a table called MainTable, and this is where
the information is stored, searched, updated, and deleted.  
Since all the information could be stored in one table I didn't see the 
need to create more than one table.  
For simplicity I made all of the database columns to be of type nchar(100).
Any information stored into the default database therefore can not be longer
than 100 characters.

Any other information about running the program or how it works should be 
covered in the user documentation
